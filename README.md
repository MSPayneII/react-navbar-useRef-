## Reason for choosing this project:

This was a hands-on React project provided by John Smilga as part of his [Udemy React Tutorial and Projects Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-tutorial-and-projects-course/). This project was designed to help students become familiar with useRef().

## Functionality:

A responsive navigation bar with logo, navigation links and social media icons on disappear from large screens. On small screens, navigation links and social media icons are replaced with a hamburger menu. Clicking the hamburger menu displays the navigation links.

- useRef() is used to resize a mobile menu's container size dynamically based on the number of menu items used.

- getBoundlientRect().height is used to obtain the height of the ul element which holds the menu items, ensuring the ul element adjusts accordingly.

- React
